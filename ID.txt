mostafa: Landing page and design:
- Search page: search all laptops by any desired criteria
- Log searches if user consents to this.
    Searching and logging use one function which takes all criteria then checks for empty ones and only searches for the criteria entered by the user. If all criteria are empty, it can display all laptops at once.
- View all: view all available laptops or just view promoted ones.
- Compare laptops: Select any two desired laptops from the drop down list and display their specs to compare them.
- Edit user data: Update email address, privacy consent, and password of user.
