Mostafa: Landing page and design:
- Search page: search all laptops by any desired criteria
- Search logs: If a user searches or views any and all laptops, it is logged provided that they agree to this (privacy consent).
    Search and view operations use one function which takes all criteria then filters laptops by the actually used ones and discards empty strings.
- View all: view all available laptops or just view promoted ones.
- Compare laptops: Select any two desired laptops from the drop down list and display their specs to compare them.
- Edit user data: Update email address, privacy consent, and password of user.
- Simple procedure to get promoted laptops
